# Employee Attrition Prediction with Machine Learning (Ongoing)
This is a machine learning project that aims to predict employee attrition using classification algorithms. The dataset used in this project is a fictional HR dataset that contains information about employees such as age, gender, job role, years of experience, salary, performance rating, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle, owned by user pavansubhash. The dataset can be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset.

## Requirements
The following packages are required to run the code:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- lightgbm
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Code Structure
The code for this project is divided into four main parts:

- `input`: This folder contains the input data for the project.

- `src`: This folder contains the source code for the project.

- `output`: This folder contains the output generated by the code. This includes evaluation metrics of the models.

- `notebook`: This folder contains Jupyter Notebook, mainly for EDA.

## Results
The best performing model was the LightGBM Classifier tuned with gaussian process, which achieved an accuracy of xxx% and an F1 score of xxx. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict employee attrition. The best performing model achieved an accuracy of xxx% and an F1 score of xxx, indicating that it can be used to identify employees who are at risk of leaving the company.
